READ ME:

Very simple APP for creating and saving checklists using Firebase's database Firestore for backend.
Each list can be individually deleted as well as its individual tasks. 
You can always see how far you have come in completing the list through the progress bar.

The current version of the APP needs more work both frontend and backend.
The UI is very plain and the APP suffers from instability issues running on the Pixel 4a SDK.


The APK has been distributed through Firebase and can be reached at the link below:
